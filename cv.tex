\item
	\ressubheading{LIGO, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee}{Milwaukee}{Research Assistant}{Research Assistant, September, 2017 - Present}
	\begin{itemize}
		\resitem{My main focus is on gravitational wave cosmology with standard sirens. I am most interested in using binary black hole events for which no electromagnetic counterpart is expected to infer cosmological parameters statistically with large galaxy surveys.}
		\resitem{I am also the lead developer of the \texttt{gwcosmo} package (to be released soon publicly) which provides analysis tools in Python to analyze gravitational wave data and infer cosmology from it. }
		\resitem{Additional work on strongly lensed gravitational wave events: detection, model selection as well as hierarchical analysis for a population of these events.}
	\end{itemize}
\item
	\ressubheading{LIGO, The Chinese University of Hong Kong}{Hong Kong}{Research Assistant}{Research Assistant, March, 2016 - Present}
	\begin{itemize}

		\resitem{We are  also developing and testing a framework for the detection of an ensemble of sub-threshold binary neutron star signals by coherently stacking them. We can infer their simulated population properties much more effectively by combining all these events.}

\item
	\ressubheading{UCSB Department of Physics}{Santa Barbara, CA}{Undergraduate Research Assistant}{Undergraduate Research Assistant, November 2016 - May 2017}
	\begin{itemize}
